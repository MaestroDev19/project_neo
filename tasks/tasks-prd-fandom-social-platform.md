### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- The GNN implementation will require specialized AI/ML libraries (PyTorch Geometric, DGL) and may need separate Python services.
- Database models should include both SQL (for structured data) and graph database (Neo4j/Neptune) for user interactions.
- Integration services should be implemented as microservices for better scalability.

#### Messaging Architecture Options

- 2. End-to-End Encrypted Centralized Messaging (Recommended)
  - Description: Messages are routed through a platformâ€™s servers, but encrypted so the server (and therefore the company) cannot read message content.
  - Examples: WhatsApp, Signal

Note: This project uses Next.js as the primary web framework (App Router), with API Route Handlers for backend endpoints.

#### UI/UX Stack

- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4
- Component Library: shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI primitives)
- Design Tokens: Tailwind CSS variables (colors, spacing, typography)
- Theming: Light/Dark themes with CSS variables and system preference support
- Accessibility: Radix UI primitives + WCAG 2.1 AA targets, keyboard navigation, focus states
- Icons: Lucide Icons
- Motion: CSS transitions; consider Framer Motion for complex interactions
